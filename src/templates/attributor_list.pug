He helped us evaluate our project ideas and encouraged us to choose an unconventional futuristic subject for our research. He casually gave us an idea that changed the whole concept for our hardware and immobilization plans and proved to be brilliant because of its simplicity. By providing lab space and helping us acquire funding, he enabled us to realize our project. We want to thank him for his feedback and ideas, which have made our project what it is.'},{'name':'Ulrich Schwaneberg','institution':'Institute for Biotechnology, RWTH Aachen University','attribution':'As head of the Institute of Biotechnology, Professor Schwaneberg not only provided us with lab space and supplies, he also introduced us to members of his team who could help us with certain issues. Furthermore, he helped us find a great instructor, Dr. Alexander Boes, who supported us through our daily lab routine. Professor Schwaneberg’s expertise in adhesion peptides inspired us to try new and innovative immobilization systems and we had the unique opportunity to try them at the Leibnitz Institute for Interactive Materials (DWI).
