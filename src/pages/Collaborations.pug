       # OSU Meet up
       In March we joined the digital Meet up of iGEM OSU.
       A lot of iGEM teams from all over the world were part of it. 
       We discussed with a lot of teams where to start with their project and how to participate in the competition. 
       In addition to that, we got to know our cooperation partners iGEM Tue, iGEM D端sseldorf, and iGEM Bonn.

       # International Survey about GMOs
       In May we met with iGEM Maastricht.
       They asked if we are interested in creating a survey about GMOs with iGEM IISER Tirupati and iGEM IISER Pune. 
       In a few meetings, we designed a questionnaire with specific questions about the topics the different teams were working on. 
       We were really interested in how the attitude towards GMOs changes depending on age and education.

       # iGEM Monument Challenge
       During the summer iGEM GO Paris Saclay organized the iGEM Monument Challenge.
       We thought that it was a really great idea and took part in it.
       We showed the Karlsbrunnen, Aachens Cathedral and the Elisenbrunnen.

       # Postcard Challenge
       As every year the iGEM Team of the Heinrich-Heine-University reached out to us offering to participate in their postcard challenge. 
       The task was to design a synthetic biology or project-related postcard and to send copies to D端sseldorf.
       In return, they send us postcards of the other participating teams. 
       Our postcard shows a TdT cartoon-like with DNA.
       We decided on this illustration because the TdT was the main enzyme for our project.

        # Rosalind Chronicles 
        As part of a collaboration between the [Ulaval] (https://2021.igem.org/Team:ULaval), [Thessaloniki] (https://2021.igem.org/Team:Thessaloniki), [Patras) (https://2021.igem.org/Team:Patras) and [Concordia] (https://2021.igem.org/Team:Concordia-Montreal) iGEM teams on the topic of women in STEM research, we participated in their "Rosalind Chronicles" project. 
        They called for an entry that would honor influential and innovative women in science.
        Each participating team wrote a text about their favorite female scientist.
        Since all members of our team agreed that women in STEM research have often been overlooked in the past, we chose a female researcher from the last century.
        Maud Leonora Menten worked in the field of enzyme kinetics and is famous for the "Michaelis-Menten equation" - a term everyone in biochemical subjects knows.
        We were impressed by her determination to work in what was then a male-dominated field, and by her decision to even move to Germany for research purposes because she was not allowed to do so in Canada.
        Michaelis-Menten kinetics also played an important role in modeling our TdT reaction, as we used the equation for calculations on dNTP incorporation (see [Modeling](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Model#Michaelis-Menten)).
        We thank the four organizing teams for the great opportunity to get to know other inspiring female scientists!
        
        > Maud Leonora Menten (March 20, 1879 -July 17, 1960) was a biomedical and medical researcher who is known for her work on enzyme kinetics and histochemistry.
        > She studied medicine at the University of Toronto and was among the first women in Canada to earn a medical doctorate.
        > Because women were not allowed to do research at the time, she decided to do research in other countries, such as Germany and the United States.
        > In Berlin (1912) she worked together with Leonor Michaelis and co-authored their paper in Biochemische Zeitschrift.
        > They showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the amount of the enzyme-substrate complex.
        > This relationship is known as the Michaelis-Menten equation.
        > She entered graduate school at the University of Chicago and obtained her PhD in 1916.
        > From 1923-1950 she worked at the University of Pittsburgh and became Assistant Professor and then Associate Professor in the school of medicine and head of pathology at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
        > In 1948 at the Medical School of the University of Pittsburgh she was awarded a professorship.

        # Online Escape Room Collaboration
        During the corona crisis, it was hard for every team to meet up for collaborations in person.
        Together with [iGEM D端sseldorf] (https://2021.igem.org/Team:Duesseldorf), [Bonn] (https://2021.igem.org/Team:Bonn) and [Kaiserslautern] (https://2021.igem.org/Team:TU_Kaiserslautern) we thought of a digital activity we could work on collectively and provide for other people.
        We came up with an online escape room: Solving riddles together and working yourselves through a story related to our projects ending at the giant jamboree! 
        Over the course of about 4 months, we worked out a script about a journey through the 4 cities of the participating teams.
        We met in Discord occasionally to discuss the progress and exchange our ideas.
        Every team contributed pictures for the storyline and 3 riddles, in which you have to apply your biological knowledge to solve them.
        The parts were finally assembled by Annika from iGEM Bonn using Google forms.
        Our riddles broached the issues of DNA synthesis, replication, and sequencing since we used all of these techniques during our project.
        iGEM Bonn thematized Lanthanide metal recycling, Kaiserslautern followed with a part about modular cloning and D端sseldorf finished with a few riddles about pathogen recognition in plants.
        We had lots of fun creating the riddles and thank the other teams for the collaboration.
        We hope that some people had fun playing the escape room!
