        # Selection of the project 
        In January, the journey in this year's iGEM competition began for us as a team. 
        In order for us to decide on a project as quickly as possible, we first did a lot of brainstorming and compiled all the ideas. 
        In the following meetings, we decided which ideas would be feasible. Three projects emerged, which we divided among ourselves and worked out further. 
        At the end of February, we were able to present the more mature ideas to our supervisors and received good feedback for two of these project ideas. 
        The final decision was made on March 12, 2021, where we chose our project "Storagene" for this year's iGEM competition.
         
        The idea of using the astonishing capacities and properties of DNA to store data fascinated us the most. 
        Its remarkable properties are information density, longevity, and also stability [1](#citation1)[2](#citation2). 
        Our project is based on the work of George Church, a world-renowned scientist in the field of synthetic biology and genome engineering. 
        His idea of enzymatic DNA synthesis with the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) for storing digital information got our attention. 
        However, this requires the synthesis of many unique DNA sequences of great length. 
        Therefore, Church developed a photon-directed method that requires a laser, a very costly acquisition with complex handling. [3](#citation3) 
         
        The specific goal of our project “Storagene”, is to synthesize DNA enzymatically using the TdT for long-term data storage. 
        Therefore, we developed the DIP method, where immobilized primer on a magnetic stick is dipped into a solution containing TdT and respective nucleotides.
        
        In the future, everbody will have their own synthesizer at home, with which DNA can be synthesized and thus personal data can be stored on the DNA in the long term.

        # Characteristics about the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
        The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) is an enzyme that possesses the unusual ability to incorporate nucleotides in a template-independent manner using only single-stranded DNA as the nucleic acid substrate. 
        Like all DNA polymerases, the TdT also requires divalent metal ions for catalysis of the phosphoryl transfer reaction associated with nucleotide incorporation. 
        However, the TdT is uniquely capable to use a variety of divalent cations such as Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+. 
        Another advantage of using the TdT is that the enzyme utilizes a wide variety of nucleotide analogs such as 2′,3′-dideoxynucleotides, p-nitrophenylethyl triphosphate, p-nitrophenyl triphosphate, 2′-deoxy-L-ribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates, and dinucleoside 5′,5′-tetraphosphates. 
        This can be used for increasing the data capacity even further for DNA data storage.
        Since we wanted to deliberately incorporate nucleotides, we had to interrupt the reaction in the standard TdT reactions. 
        Heat and many different metal chelators can be used for inhibiting the TdT activity, such as: o-phenanthroline, EDTA, triethylene-tetramine, α:α'-bipyridyl, and cysteine.
