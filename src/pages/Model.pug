        # Our Idea and Goal
        
        When we started thinking about a model we had the aspiration that it could contribute to our project in a meaningful way.
        Since the key to our synthesis is a chemical reaction we started by constructing a model simulating the elongation of our primer. 
        Using this model we can predict concentrations of DNA strands of different lengths in dependence on parameters like time, nucleotide concentration, or enzyme concentration.
        We aspired to go through a complete modeling process: from constructing a reaction network to evaluating the model with experimental data and finally applying it to gain knowledge about particular kinetic parameters, like e.g. the length of the synthesis cycle, to support our wet-lab work.
        In the best-case scenario, we would construct a new dynamic model, which would also fit the experimental results. 
        Generally speaking, the most crucial aspect of modeling is to gain knowledge about particular problems. 
        So to be useful in our project, we had to construct a model which is complex enough to answer our questions with a certain validity but also simple enough to avoid unnecessary problems like missing parameters or too deep interaction description.
        Additionally, we created a 3D animation using UCSF Chimera, to visualize the elongation on a molecular level. 
        That helped us also to understand the molecular interaction interactions during the reaction.

        # Fundamentals of kinetics modeling
        
        The fundamental idea behind a reaction network is that the concentration of each component in the network is represented by a so-called pool.
        When one component reacts to become another one, the pools are connected.
        This connection is called flux and represents the change of substance a and b.

    +image(1,imgpath,"Pools and fluxes of DNA elongation by the TdT.",60, 0.8)
    
    :markdown-it
    
        Since the fluxes are not constant and depend on the pool sizes, they need to be integrated over time to know the concentration at a certain timepoint.

        In order to be able to apply this model some assumptions need to be made:
        
        * the reverse reaction does not happen
        * the pool size of DNAn  has no influence on the reactions velocity vn
        * enzyme and DNA dissociate after each reaction

        
        # Michaelis-Menten
        
        The first approach was to calculate the reaction velocities according to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 
        Therefore the nucleotide that would be incorporated was considered as the substrate and the DNA strands were assumed to be present in excess. 
        Thereby the reaction velocity could be calculated by the Michaelis-Menten equation with a value for the dNTP affinity from the literature [2](#citation2). 
        For each length of the resulting DNA strands, a new pool was created, and the flux from one pool to the next was modeled as explained. 
        As a result, the concentrations of the different DNA pools were obtained as a function of the time (figure 2).
        The most intriguing part here was the concentration of not at all elongated strands since these would lead to an error in the encoded information.
        This approach, however, could be improved. 
        As we found out later that the enzyme was not saturated with DNA strands in our lab conditions, we elaborated a new kinetic model.

        # Two Substrate Model
        
        Since the TdT catalyzes reactions in *two substrate, two product random order* mechanism [1](#citation1) a corresponding equation was used.
        To acquire a deeper understanding of the reactions we plotted the pool sizes of DNA strands of different lengths over time (figure 3) and the length distribution at different timestamps (figure 4). 
        In figure 3, a delayed rise in concentrations can be seen. 
        That could be explained by the dependency of the flux towards DNA1 to the pool size of DNA0 et cetera. 
        
        $$\frac{dDNA}{dt} = \frac{v_{max} \cdot c_{DNA} \cdot c_{dNTP}}{K_{DNA} \cdot K_{dNTP}+K_{DNA} \cdot c_{dNTP}+K_{dNTP} \cdot c_{DNA} +c_{DNA} \cdot c_{dNTP}}$$

        With increasing time the mean of the strand length distribution rises and the distribution becomes broader. 
        Although this result was not surprising, it is still valuable, because it shows that the reaction time should be as short as possible, not only to shorten synthesis cycles but also to avoid longer strands. 
        As seen in figure 5 the gained data from the capillary electrophoresis confirms our model [(Results)](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Results). 
        The capillary electrophoresis data shows the same length distribution as our model predicted.
        The concentration decreases along with an increasing strand length distribution.
        
        # Optimization
        
        We did parameter analysis not only to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction but also to find the ideal reaction conditions.
        Because we were facing an optimization problem for our system (Error rate, time, concentration), we wanted to find the ideal operating point for our DNA synthesis. 
        The independent parameters were enzyme- and nucleotide concentration and reaction time. 
        The repercussions of a change of these parameters are shown in figure  5.

    +image(6,imgpath,"Optimization problem of our system.",60, 0.8)
    
    :markdown-it
  
        To calculate these reaction parameters we varied the nucleotide concentration and plotted the course of the reaction for each concentration to get a 3-dimensional plot.
        The same procedure was performed with time and nucleotide concentration as independent parameters.
        Because we are facing an optimization problem in our system, we need data like this to find the ideal reaction conditions.

        As can be seen, the nucleotide concentration, here ATP, has a rather small influence on the velocity of the reaction, especially at longer reaction times.
        By contrast, the amount of enzyme naturally has a drastic influence on the reaction's velocity at short reaction times. With longer reaction times this effect becomes less drastic.
        Since the enzyme is the most expensive component in our system and has the biggest influence on reaction velocity, its optimized use is the top priority.
        Based on this data we decided that our ideal reaction conditions are at 0.4 mol/L ATP and 0.8 enzyme Units following the criteria mentioned in figure 5.
        While operating at these conditions an error rate of <10% can be achieved with a reaction time of about 100 seconds.
       
        Another thing worth mentioning is the different incorporation of nucleotides. 
        According to  $K_{m}$  and  $v_{max}$ , values ATP and GTP get incorporated much faster than CTP and TTP (figure 8).
        This knowledge helped us to choose the right reaction time for each nucleotide and prevent irregularities in length for synthesized strands.

        # Applying Wet Lab Data
        
        To evaluate our simulation results we compared them with the experimental data gained from the capillary electrophoresis. 
        This experiment is particularly suitable because a large amount of data is available in digital form. 
        Since our network consists of coupled differential equations, we wrote a nonlinear regression program in MATLAB.  
        These reaction networks are normally time-dependent so time is the only variable during a reaction in the same reaction setup. 
        Since our system consists of three kinetic parameters, we compared our used parameters [2](#citation2) with the calculated ones from the regression program. 
        This way we could validate our model and compare the differences between literature, our model, and the experimental results. 
        All of the above-mentioned was done with the ‚Äúlsqcurvefit‚Äù command of Matlab. 
        That is a nonlinear curve-fitting solver that solves the defined problem in a least-squares sense. 
        Solvers which work like ours define a minimization function that first subtracts the simulated results from the experimental ones. 
        The results of that then get squared and the squared values get added up. 
        This function gets minimized by varying the defined system parameters until the solver reaches a minimum for the function. 
        The set of values for the parameters for which the minimum is found is then the end result. 
        That would be the ideal set of kinetic parameters which fit the best with the experimental data. 
       
        For the regression, we also used previous modeling results to simplify the system, which helped reduce the computing time and made the model more efficient. 
        Instead of using a time-dependent pool for the ATPs in the reaction equations, we just used a constant value for the ATP concentration. 
        This assumption was made because with the three-dimensional plot we found out that the starting concentration of the nucleotides barely influences the kinetics of the reaction network. 
        That makes sense considering the phenomenon of substrate saturating, which plays a key factor in enzyme kinetics. 
        So for our examined time interval for the elongation process, we make the assumption that our system is saturated with ATP.

        In the following, the regression results are discussed. 
        The upper plot shows the results for the first three pools (non-elongated DNA strand, DNA strand which got elongated by one base pair, and the DNA strand which got elongated by two base pairs). 
        We limited the plot to these three pools because more graphs would make the plot unclear. 
        Regression analysis is usually a tough task in biological fields because there are way higher measurement errors than in other disciplines.
        Besides our simulated results fit very well to the wet lab data which is astonishing, considering the fact that we constructed a completely new and multilayered model with our own assumptions. 
        The new estimated kinetic parameters are:
        
        * $v_{max}$ = 0.00006150 $\frac{mol}{l \cdot s}$ (0.0000083  $\frac{mol}{l \cdot s}$  in literature)
        * $K_{DNA}$ = 0.00015318 $\frac{mol}{l}$ (0.001  $\frac{mol}{l}$  in literature)
        * $K_{ATP}$ = 0.00021808 $\frac{mol}{l}$ (0.0001  $\frac{mol}{l}$  in literature)
        
        
        
        # Conclusion and Outlook

        Through a *discover define design deliver* cycle we managed to create a reliable model of our reaction.
        [//]: # (Ich denke hier sollten nur Verben verwendet werden)
        By modelling the reaction system of the DNA synthesis in silico, we could gain much information about how the system behaves. 
        That helped us understand the kinetics of the elongation reaction and which are the crucial factors to be analyzed in more detail.  
        After understanding the reaction process in detail, the data we obtained from the capillary electrophoresis was used to adjust the parameters from the literature to our model. 
        Furthermore, we evaluated the influences of varying the most important factors and found effective optimization approaches. 
        With the data we generated, we could help the wet lab team to find the most efficient approach to optimize the reaction conditions.
        Besides all, we were very privileged to test and confirm our model by the generated data from the wet lab.
        We know that not every team had this year the opportunity to do this additional step.

        Our model could be extended to gain further insights into possible optimization. 
        First, the CE experiment could be repeated to minimize wet-lab data errors. 
        Further, we could adapt our model on synthesized DNA from our hardware, to especially describe the kinetics of the reaction in our hardware.        
        Yet, we just studied short elongation with one nucleotide sort. 
        Along with this modification effects like secondary structures and other molecular interactions affect the reaction kinetics.
