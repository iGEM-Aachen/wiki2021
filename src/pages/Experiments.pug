        The goals of our experiments were the following:

        * Characterizing the terminal transferase (TdT) reaction and showing that TdT can incorporate nucleotides to ssDNA primers
        * Investigating the problem of secondary structures during strand elongation
        * Immobilizing our ssDNA primers
        * Performing a cyclic semi-specific synthesis, in which an unknown number of one nucleotide type is attached in each reaction cycle 
        * Proving that this semi-specific synthesis works and that data can be encoded and recovered in this way by sequencing the created fragments

        Our lab notebook is available [here](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Notebook).

        The results are summarized [here](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Results).

        # TdT Tailing Reaction
        The first step was to test whether TdT binds nucleotides to an ssDNA primer. 
        A standard TdT tailing reaction was performed and verified by [gel electrophoresis](#GelElectrophoresis). 
        To better characterize the reaction, many parameters such as incubation time and temperature as well as nucleotide, primer, cofactor, and enzyme concentration were varied. 
        Different nucleotides and combinations of those were tried to reveal significant differences in incorporation speed. This information was crucial for building hardware that can attach a roughly equal amount of each nucleotide, following the principle of: “As little as possible and as much as necessary“. 
        This means that the goal is to find conditions where each strand is elongated as little as possible, but with at least one nucleotide in each cycle (see [modeling](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Modeling)). For this purpose, the length distribution of the synthesized fragments was analyzed by [capillary electrophoresis](#CapillaryElectrophoresis).
        
        Furthermore, different TdTs were tested. In the first experiments, we used a recombinant TdT from NEB, but all other experiments were performed with a recombinant TdT from Thermo Fischer Scientific. They use very different reaction buffers, which significantly changed the incorporation speed and nucleotide preferences of TdT. All our summarized results concern the Thermo Fisher TdT.
        
        # Primer Immobilization
        For the semi-specific synthesis, the TdT reaction in solution has the decisive disadvantage that the different nucleotides mix after the first few reaction cycles because there still is a nucleotide excess after each reaction step with that specific nucleotide. 
        Hence, it is not ensured that the added nucleotide is also the incorporated nucleotide and synthesis errors accumulate.
        
        Therefore, the sample would have to be purified after each step to isolate the extended ssDNA strands and lose excess nucleotides.
        
        Immobilizing the primers can solve this problem and is the basis for a cyclic synthesis of longer strands. 
        Current techniques involve a flowcell with different master mixes (citation needed). For our purpose, the primers were immobilized on a stick and dipped into the reaction solutions with the different nucleotides. 
        Various immobilization systems were tried: 
       
        # Gel Electrophoresis
        For first sample analysis, our method of choice was the agarose gel electrophoresis because of easy handling and fast results. The final target was to sequence our self-generated DNA fragments, but sequencing methods had to be established first. 
        As the first samples were generated with only one type of nucleotide, length determination was most important. 
        For our samples (low concentrated very short ssDNA fragments, ~20-1000 nt), the best length analysis method (apart from [capillary electrophoresis](#CapillaryElectrophoresis)) would typically be a denaturing PAGE, which was tried but rejected because of inconsistent results and performance difficulties. 
        We lost a lot of time at the beginning of our project due to the optimization attempts, as making our DNA strands visible was the first critical step. At last, we found conditions for an agarose gel electrophoresis that enabled us to clearly see ssDNA samples (see [engineering success]( https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Engineering)). 
        A 2.5% agarose solution in TBE buffer was used. 
        The gel was stained with SYBR gold solution for 20 min. A dsDNA ladder was used because we did not need a precise length determination. 
        These conditions were not optimal but sufficed for a first rough assessment of the samples, which would then undergo other analysis steps.
       
        # Capillary Electrophoresis
        We had the possibility to let our samples be analyzed with a fragment analyzer at Fraunhofer Institute IME. 
        This analysis method has several advantages over gel electrophoresis: Fragments from 35bp to 500bp can be sized to within 1bp resolution and can be polymorphic in their lengths. [1](https://www.ime.fraunhofer.de/en/Research_Divisions/business_fields_MB/services/dna_fragmentanalyse.html) 
        In addition, ssDNA can be analyzed.
        
        So this was the perfect method to detect small differences in length and establish the length distribution for different nucleotides and conditions. 
        
        Of course, this is no sequencing method and it cannot tell, which nucleotides are incorporated. 
        Furthermore, one needs primers labeled with a fluorescent dye to be detected by the fragment analyzer. 
        It was therefore not possible to analyze immobilized DNA because it was already labeled with the immobilization group.
        
        The TdT reaction with the fluorescent-labeled primers was performed in the same way as with the unlabeled primers. 
        We used primers labeled with 6FAM.

        # PCR
        It is difficult to sequence ssDNA strands, in particular those with polymorphic length. 
        So we wanted to develop a PCR system that would enable us to amplify polymorphic single strands with an unknown sequence and make them double-stranded in the process. 
        A standard PCR utilizes the fact that the specific sequence to be amplified is well-known. 
        Complementary PCR primers can be designed. We only know the sequence of the beginning of our strand because it belongs to our self-designed TdT reaction primer. 
        Due to the semi-specific synthesis, however, the exact sequence of attached nucleotides is unknown.
        
        We propose a system in which the reverse primer for the PCR has a poly-T sequence. 
        Now we only have to make sure, that a poly-A sequence is attached at the end of the strand. 
        Furthermore, we designed the PCR primers with an overhang that contains a restriction site for cloning purposes.
        
        Problems with this system are that the poly-T primer not only binds to the very end of, but to any poly-A sequence in the strand. 
        One could avoid using dATP to elongate the strand and only use it for poly-A tailing, but this would limit the data capacity for encoding information. 
        Furthermore, the poly-T primer has a low annealing temperature, favoring unspecific PCR products (citation needed?).
