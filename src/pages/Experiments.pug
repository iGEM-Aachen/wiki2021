        The goals of our experiments were the following:

        * Characterizing the terminal transferase (TdT) reaction and showing that TdT can incorporate nucleotides to ssDNA primers
        * Investigating the problem of secondary structures during strand elongation
        * Immobilizing our ssDNA primers
        * Performing a cyclic semi-specific synthesis, in which an unknown number of one nucleotide type is attached in each reaction cycle 
        * Proving that this semi-specific synthesis works and that data can be encoded and recovered in this way by sequencing the created fragments

        Our lab notebook is available [here](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Notebook).
        Detailed protocols can be found [here](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Protocols).
        The results are summarized [here](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Results).


        # TdT Tailing Reaction
        The first step was to test whether TdT binds nucleotides to an ssDNA primer. A standard TdT tailing reaction was performed and verified by [](#gel-electrophoresis). To better characterize the reaction, many parameters such as incubation time and temperature as well as nucleotide, primer, cofactor, and enzyme concentration were varied. Different nucleotides and combinations of those were tried to reveal significant differences in incorporation speed. This information was crucial for building hardware that can attach a roughly equal amount of each nucleotide, following the principle of: “As little as possible and as much as necessary“. This means that the goal is to find conditions, where each strand is elongated as little as possible, but with at least one nucleotide in each cycle (see [modeling](https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Modeling)). For this purpose, the length distribution of the synthesized fragments was analyzed by [](#capillary-electrophoresis).
        # Primer Immobilization
        For the semi-specific synthesis, the TdT reaction in solution has the decisive disadvantage that the different nucleotides mix after the first few reaction cycles because there still is a nucleotide excess after each reaction step with that specific nucleotide. It is then not ensured that the added nucleotide is also the incorporated nucleotide and synthesis errors accumulate.
        Therefore, the sample would have to be purified after each step to isolate the extended ssDNA strands and lose excess nucleotides.
        Immobilization of the primers can solve this problem and is the basis for a cyclic synthesis of longer strands. (Current techniques involve a flowcell with different mastermixes (citation needed)) For our purpose, the primers were immobilized on a stick and dipped into the reaction solutions with the different nucleotides. Various immobilization systems were tried: 
        # Gel electrophoresis
        For first sample analysis, our method of choice was the agarose gel electrophoresis because of easy handling and fast results. The final target was of course to sequence our self-generated DNA fragments, but sequencing methods had to be established first. As the first samples were generated with only one type of nucleotide, length determination was most important. For our samples (low concentrated very short ssDNA fragments, ~20-1000 nt) the best length analysis method (apart from capillary electrophoresis) would normally be a denaturing PAGE, which was tried but rejected because of inconsistent results and performance difficulties. We lost a lot of time at the beginning of our project due to the optimization attempts, as making our DNA strands visible was the first critical step in our project. At last, we found conditions for an agarose gel electrophoresis that enabled us to clearly see ssDNA samples (see engineering success): A 2.5% agarose solution in TBE buffer was used. The gel was stained with SYBR gold solution for 20 min. A dsDNA ladder was used because we did not need a precise length determination. These conditions were not optimal but sufficed for a first rough assessment of the samples, which would then undergo other analysis steps.
