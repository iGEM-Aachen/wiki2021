        # Overview Team- and Working-Structure
        ## General
        - Elect a Team Leader that is responsible for organizing the whole team and especially watches the competition requirements as well as the deadlines.
        It is recommended that this person takes a vacation semester. 
        
        - Elect a Subgroup Leader for every subgroup you have (like lab, human practices, design, …).
        This person is communicating with the Team Leader and is also responsible to organize their subgroup 
        
        - Use Microsoft Teams as a team platform 
        
        - For any sort of regular meeting, it is advisable to use the method of ‘silent meetings’.
        It works as follows:
        Before the meeting, every subgroup leader (or person with news) writes a detailed description about what he or she has to say.
        When the meeting begins, everyone mutes themselves and reads through the agenda.
        When finished, participant can e.g. give response through raising their hands digitally.
        For questions during the meeting, one can use the comment feature in Word.
        Once everyone finished reading, the team can go over to discuss topics that require further discussion.
        This method has two major advantages:
        
        1. Members that missed the meeting can easily catch up.
        2. It tremendously reduces the time needed for a meeting. 
        
        - Carefully think about the file organisation in Teams and properly name documents, e.g. with dates.
        Prevent naming files ‘presentation’, ‘presentation_new’, ‘presentation_updated’, … as this only causes confusion. 
        
        - Right from the beginning, start a list with every person that contributed to your project in any way, like ‘experts’, ‘supervisors’, ‘sponsors’. 
        
        - Use a calendar to keep track of every meeting happening. You can also use it to for vacation periods for members of your team. 
        
        - Use ‘github’ for your wiki.
        It allows the wiki team to easily set up the wiki from github, it keeps the progress structured and allows constant backups in case some things go wrong.
        
        ## Laboratory Subgroup
        - It is recommendable to have at least one meeting a week. This year, we had two meetings a week: one general update meeting and one meeting on Fridays to plan experiments for the next week. 

        - You can plan your available people for the next week or next weeks by implementing a shift availability schedule into Teams. The subgroup leader then used this shift availability schedule to plan the shifts for the next week in a Google Calendar. We used a simple Excel table:
        
    - var imgpath = "" + require("../assets/img/contribution/Schedule.jpg")["Alternative Text"]
    +image(1, imgpath, "Schedule Planner for Laboratory Subgroup")
       
    :markdown-it
        - It is advisable to assign specific tasks to group members, e.g. one or two people that are responsible for any orders, people that focus more on research or communication with supervisors and experts. 

        - Additionally to the shift availability schedule, we implemented a general availability plan for the remaining weeks of the competition in order to estimate the general capacities. Example of how this can look like:
        
    - var imgpath = "" + require("../assets/img/contribution/Verfügbarkeiten.jpg")["Alternative Text"]
    +image(1, imgpath, "Availability Planner")
       
    :markdown-it
        ## Labwork Organization
        - Instead of a manual labwork, it is highly recommendable to use a digital notebook. We settled on the program ‘Benchling’ as it provided the best structure and features in the free version. Using a digital notebook makes organisation much easier, it allows every member to easily follow up, and makes follow up work much more convenient. 

        - Below, you can see our general folder structure with organisational features that will be described in more detail below:
        
    - var imgpath = "" + require("../assets/img/contribution/Benchling_Structure.jpg")["Alternative Text"]
    +image(1, imgpath, "Structural Organization in Benchling")
       
    :markdown-it
        - We started to introduce ‘Standard Operation Procedures’ (SOP). These are detailed protocols for used methods in the lab that follow a destinct structure. The goal of an SOP should be, that every member of your team can perform a method just by reading through the SOP. The usage of SOPs has two advantages: 1. Each member can perform every method relevant for the project, while also reducing the risk of errors or error propagation; 2. When you write a protocol, you can use Benchlings tag function to tag the SOPs that you use for the performed experiment. Below, you can find the general structure that an SOP should follow as well as an example SOP. 

    - var imgpath = "" + require("../assets/img/contribution/SOP_Structure.jpg")["Alternative Text"]
    +image(1, imgpath, "SOP Structure")
       
    :markdown-it
        - In addition to the SOP, you should use the same protocol structure for all your experiments. For this, we added a standard protocol structure that is followed at all times. This ensures a clear structure for all your experiments and allows to each member to quickly understand what an experiment is about. You can find our standard protocol structure below: 
        
    - var imgpath = "" + require("../assets/img/contribution/Protocol_Structure.jpg")["Alternative Text"]
    +image(1, imgpath, "Protocol Structure")
       
    :markdown-it
        - Adding a To-Do list to your Benchling can help you organise tasks and planned experiments. In the To-Do list, we defined short-, mid-, and long-term goals and experiments 

        - Another important part of lab organisation is keeping up with an inventory. It helps everyone to immediately find where everything needed is stored. It is advisable to assign each tube its own place in a storage box. To get a better understanding of the system, the picture below displays how we approached our inventory system. You should also always add the place of storage of these boxes (e.g. freezer, fridge, ...)
        
    - var imgpath = "" + require("../assets/img/contribution/Inventory.jpg")["Alternative Text"]
    +image(1, imgpath, "Inventory Organization")
      
    - var imgpath = "" + require("../assets/img/contribution/Box_Organization.jpg")["Alternative Text"]
    +image(1, imgpath, "Freezer and Fridge Box Organization")
    
    :markdown-it
        - A further step towards an organized lab is the usage of a table in which you keep track of all your orders and planned orders. This way, every member can check what was ordered and not just the person responsible for orders.
        
    - var imgpath = "" + require("../assets/img/contribution/Box_Orders.jpg")["Alternative Text"]
    +image(1, imgpath, "Laboratory Orders Organization")
    
    :markdown-it
        - Labelling of Tubes. We cannot stress this enough, please label your tubes properly to avoid any confusion and mistakes in the lab. Always right down whats in the tube, the date, and also the concentration (if applicable). Since the labels wash off easily when they are frozen or they get into touch with any detergent, you should use circular paper stickers for labelling (see image below). If you have multiple copies or aliquotes of one reagent, you can mark the tube in usage with an ‘X’ so that you empty one tube before using another one.
        
    - var imgpath = "" + require("../assets/img/contribution/Labeling.jpg")["Alternative Text"]
    +image(1, imgpath, "Proper Labeling of Tubes")
    
    :markdown-it
        - Try to define the way of writing units, labelling tables, labelling images, etc. from the beginning and make sure to follow this structure. This reduces the amount of revision and correction that you have to do afterwards.
