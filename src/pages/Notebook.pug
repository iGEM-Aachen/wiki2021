        # Notebook

        This section is thought to contain rough explanations of the experiments for each weak. We want to structure it based on the different parts of the experiments (see below)
        # TdT Tailing Reaction
        # Primer Immobilization
        # SSBs
        # (Short Oligos)
        # (Unnatural Bases)
