        # Week 33
            In the beginning, we performed a TdT tailing reaction with dATP and a mixture of ACG nucleotides to amplify our samples with a PCR reaction and get two inserts for the pGEM cloning reaction. 
            We generated the poly-A tail ourselves, by adding 1 µL of nucleotide A to our reaction. 
            At first, it did not seem to work, because we saw no difference in the length distributions of our bands. 
            Despite that, we carried on to perform the PCR reaction and saw a blurry elongation for the ACG reactions. 
            
            We continued by using a DNA recovery kit and measured our dissolved DNA with the nanodrop to get an idea of the final concentrations. 
            Furthermore, we analyzed last week´s primer–anchor peptide conjugates with an SDS Page and Western blot, to examine the protein. 
            Afterwards, we prepared Maleimid Primer – peptide reactions to assess the conjugation rate further.
            
        # Week 34 Maleimid immobilization X

            This week we first analysed a TdT reaction with conjugated Primers in solution. 
            We decided to keep the stock concentration of the protein constant, therefore the resulting concentration of primer in the TdT tailing reaction varied. 

            The next day we began to purify the protein-primer-conjugate by useing nickel beads to analyse the concentrations and show wheather the conjugates would be visible on the protein gel.
            Later we analysed both the purifies samples and the flow through on an agarose gel to see the effect on the purification and analyse the success of washing and purification. 
            Unfortunately, we estimated the primer and protein concentration wrong so the references were not visible. 
            Thus we repeaded the experiment and re-analysed the TdT samples in higher concentrations.

            After the successful experiment yesterday, we carried out our first immobilization with the maleimid-conjugates on a stick. 
            We analysed different reaction conditions, wash steps and negative controls to gather as much information out of the samples.

           # Week 35 Testing immobilization on a stick
           
                This week we focused on continuing to examine the Maleimid- immobilization on a stick.
                We repeated the experiment from last week with LCI-GC 1 on a smaller scale and tested the influence of the buffer on the adsorption of the anchor peptide. 
                No bright bands were visible so we assessed the influence of the buffer again.
 
                To obtain clear immobilization results we wanted to examine wheater Triton-X-100 (a component of the NEB TdT reaction buffer) could serve as a potential alternative to the ThermoFisher TdT reaction buffer. 
                Thus we prepared LCI GC 1 samples with different buffer compositions. Again, no bands were visible.
 
                After yesterday's failed experiment, we attempted to measure the conjugate samples with the nanodrop to obtain a greater insight into the „real“ concentrations of the conjugates. 
                We measured 1 µL of all samples and gained significantly lower results than expected. 
 
                Furthermore, we evaluated the influence of the buffer composition on the TdT reaction again with a different setup. 
                This time, the samples were prepared with LCI AT and one µM conjugate concentrations (much higher than before). 
                
                Samples with AT-Maleimid Primer were prepared as well to function as a negative control to see if the primer would stick on its own. As a result, faint bands were visible.
                Additionally, the samples were measured with the nanodrop to gather additional information.
                
                The next day, new TdT reactions were analyzed with Thermo TdT and NEB buffer to check if the immobilizations worked better. 
                To increase the concentration of the primer-protein conjugate, we first started a TdT reaction and immobilized the primer during the reaction.  
                Continuing our first experiments, we focused on analyzing whether a higher primer concentration influenced the running characteristics of the agarose gel. 
                Therefore we created TdT reactions with primer concentrations from 20 to 1000 nM for the AT-rich as well as the GC-rich primer and analyzed them with an agarose gel.

            # Week 36
                Immobilization:
                Since the majority of the results from last week were inconclusive, we continued experimenting with the NEB buffer and TdT reactions with different primer concentrations.
                In the first experiment, we used the LCI-GC1 conjugate and mixed NEB and ThermoFisher TdT/buffer. 
                Because the results were too vague, the experiment was repeated with the same samples.
                
                In KW 34 high bands were obtained, which seemed to be stuck in the pockets of the gel. 
                To analyze whether the TdT can elongate this far, different primer concentrations were examined with a normal TdT reaction. 
                After a reaction time of 25 mins, an agarose gel was obtained. 
                The remaining samples were not inactivated and the reaction was incubated overnight.
                The electrophoresis was inconclusive, so a new gel was obtained.
                
                The next day, the overnight incubated samples were applied on a gel to see how far the reaction was elongated.
                Furthermore, a PCR reaction with samples from the immobilization experiment from KW 34 was driven. 
                All conjugates were analyzed and a gel with positive, negative controls, Primer-Conjuagte immobilization reactions, and their PCR reactions was acquired.
                
                To see if the visible bands were not-conjugated primers or parted conjugate from the stick, the bands from the gel were excised and analyzed. 
                The NucleoSpin-PCR-cleanup-kit was used according to the protocol. 
                The resulting samples were transferred onto a Trans-Blot Turbo membrane and the visible spots were assessed.
                
                Additionally, the immobilization on cuvette sticks with direct application of SYBR gold was carried out to show the advantage of the immobilized conjugate in contrast to the pure primer. 
                Thus, drying steps between the immobilization and washing were incorporated as well as applying small amounts of primer and conjugate directly to the stick.
                Comparing the ThermoFisher and NEB TdT reaction buffer, TdT-maleimid-Immobilisation reactions were carried out with LCI-AT conjugates and negative controls with AT-rich primers.
                To further assess the reaction conditions of the NEB buffer, different incubations times from 30 minutes up to 230 mins were tested and for GC-rich and AT-rich primer compared.
                
                First experiments: Optimizing PCR reaction
                Optimizing our PCR reactions, different amounts of template DNA were used. 
                In order to make this possible we prepared 5 PCR mixes with different volumes of template DNA using the nucleotide T and reference reactions. 
                The results were not as expected, consequently, the samples were applied again with normal TdT reactions as reference.
                Following up on the previous experiment, the PCR reaction with the GC primer was repeated with an increased annealing temperature. 
                Unfortunately, the wrong primers were used for the PCR reaction, so the experiment had to be repeated.


             # Week 37:
                Immobilization:
                As the results from the last immobilization were flawed, the experiment was repeated with a few modifications. 
                The stick surface was treated with sandpaper to create a rough surface, the initial dNTP concentration was increased and the mobilization was performed with Triton-X-100 instead of heat. 
                The Primer-immobilisation on cuvette stirrers was performed according to protocol. 
                
                First experiments:
                Continuing our proof of concept work, we finally created a simple TdT reaction with several base transitions. 
                Two reactions were performed in parallel one with AT-rich primers and one with CE-labelled AT-rich primers for a potential analysis with the capillary electrophoresis. 
                The nucleotides were added in the following order: T, C, G, A with each 10 min incubation time. 
                Nucleotide A was added last to create a Poly-A tail to allow a later PCR amplification. The experiment worked and bands were visible on the gel.
                
                Hybridization:
                This week we started our first tests with small oligos, which hybridized with the elongated primers, to analyze the prevention of secondary structures. 
                TdT reaction with nucleotides T and G and the GC-rich primer were carried out. 
                The small oligos were added to the TdT reaction mix and different concentrations were tested. 
                The results were inconclusive.





              # Week 38:

                To recreate a cyclic TdT reaction, the experiment from last week was repeated and a few changes were performed. 
                The incubation time was changed from 10 to 15 minutes and the dNTP reaction was significantly increased to hopefully obtain clearer results.
                
                Furthermore, we continued the Hybridisation experiment from last week by re-running the samples without the 3A3C oligo while testing the 5A5C oligo. 
                Unfortunately, the experiment had to be repeated, because the normal TdT reaction did not show a band on the gel.
                
                Additionally, we aimed to test which SO concentration worked best for our 3A3C sample, so we examined different volumes of SO´s in our reactions ( 1 to 20 µL ).
                
                Continuing the previous experiment, we repeated the reaction conditions with the 5A5C So´s and the volumes 1 µL and 10 µL.
