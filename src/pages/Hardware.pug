        #Motivation
        This year the project aimed to construct an enzymatic de novo DNA-Synthesis for data storage. 
        Since our motivation is using it for the long-term storage of huge amounts of data, a high level of automation is crucial. 
        Of course, there are already existing devices for DNA synthesis, 
        but the already well-engineered devices for the traditional phosphoramidite synthesis rely on a fundamentally different principle while newer approaches for enzymatical DNA syntheses have major drawbacks when it comes to the synthesis of long strands. 
        Due to these reasons, we decided to construct a new hardware from scratch that is specially adapted to our needs.
        For the commercial application, also an optimization towards a fast and cheap operation should remain possible.
    
        The DIP method allowed us to take a completely new approach to automate DNA synthesis. We wanted to keep it as simple as possible so that it could be easily replicated. 
        The simplest way to automate the DIP method is to work with a revolver containing reaction vessels with the enzyme solutions and one nucleotide each, as well as two reaction vessels with wash solution.
        The DNA primers are immobilized on a rod, which can be dipped into the various solutions via an arm.
        To implement our idea of the hardware, we used standardized aluminum profiles as a base, to which the individual components were movably attached. 
        Both the turret and the moving arm are driven by a stepper motor via a toothed belt. These motors are controlled by a computer to match the desired DNA sequence. 
        Most of the components are commercially available. The revolver and the holder of the rod were printed with a 3D printer.
        This is how to operate the hardware:
            1. Connect the device to the power
            2. Log in to the WLAN network
            3. Calibrate the device
            4. Enter the base sequence to be synthesized in the text field
        #Outlook
        We were able to build a device with which the method developed in this project for enzymatic DNA synthesis can run fully automatically. 
        A network connection was also implemented through which digital data can be directly compiled into a base sequence and synthesized into a DNA strand. 
        Of course, much can be improved on this fundamental design of the hardware. For example, the overall design could be made even more compact, and casing with cooling would be beneficial. 
        Furthermore, use could be made easier with LCD displays showing status. Data would be sent to the device, it would calibrate itself and the status of the operation would be read on the display. 
        This handling would be made even easier by a REST API (Standardized Programming Interface), which would directly link the software and hardware code.
