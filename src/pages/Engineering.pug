        # Overview

        In our project, we had to overcome multiple obstacles and we therefore performed multiple engineering cycles. 
        The main goal of the project is to encode information into DNA. 
        To achieve that goal, we had to establish analytical methods for different purposes: for broad and detailed length analysis. 
        Concerning the prevention of secondary structures, we examined the use of single-stranded binding proteins and small oligonucleotides. 
        Lastly, we had to immobilize primers to synthesize a pre-set base sequence.
        
        # Analysis
        
      Our synthesized strands were small in size, low in concentration, and on top of that were single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which made it hard to run standard protocols for nucleic acid analysis. We, therefore, had to establish new procedures for our unconventional samples. 

        ## Electrophoresis

        Coarse electrophoresis like agarose and polyacrylamide (PAA) is a fast and easy method. 
        However, there are many different variable parameters like the concentration of Agarose and PAA, dying method, time, voltage, or buffer. 
        First, we tried the commonly used TRIS-Acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer with a 1% Agarose gel and the Roti GelRed stain. 
        With these parameters, we did not manage to visualize the synthesized DNA from our first experiments. 
        After some research and advice from experts, we tried out TRIS-Borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer and raised the agarose concentration to 2.5%. 
        With these parameters, we were able to see smaller fragments but could not observe lower concentrations. 
        Through research on the GelRed stain and our contacts at ThermoFisher, we decided to continue our work with the SYBR Gold stain, which suited our products because of its high sensitivity even for single-stranded samples. 
        With the new stain, it was possible to see our primers (GALI) on a Agarose gel, but it was impossible to do a highly resolved comparison of short fragements. 
        To compare our reactions, we ordered a 100 nt primer (AT-rich, GC-rich), and by adjusting other parameters like time and voltage, we got relatively sharp bands with a resolution of around +/- 20 nt. 
        Now that we have established a broad method for analyzing our fragments, we were able to study the reaction conditions of our enzyme, like cofactor dependency, preferred nucleotide, reaction time, or reaction temperature.
        But we were not able to visualize small differences of 1-3 nucleotides, which would be important concerning the efficient and material-saving synthesis of many nucleotide transitions.

        To tackle this problem, we wanted to establish the PAA-electrophoresis. 
        After some research, we decided to try a 15% PAA Gel with GelRed post-staining. 
        This method has been proven to be more difficult and time-consuming than agarose gel electrophoresis. 
        Regarding this method, the GelRed stain also did not work. 
        Concerning voltage and running time through trial and error, we found out that 100 V and 1 hour suited the best for our samples. 
        After some more research and an informative meeting with Dr. Zimmermann, we performed a Silver Staining. However, this time-intensive and complicated method did not work for our samples. 
        Due to hazardous ingredients and lengthy experiment procedure, we stopped pursuing this method. 
        After a couple of successful Agarose gels, we tested SYBR Gold stain, which could visualize all of our products, even our 21 nt GALI primer. 
        Additionally, we were able to examine differences around 5 nt.

        To analyze our samples even more in detail, we tried to use capillary electrophoresis (CE). 
        Sebastian Palluk recommended us the experts from the IME in Aachen. 
        After the first meeting with Dr. Muth and Mrs. Freund, we ordered our primers (AT-rich, GC-rich) with the 6FAM fluorescent modification at the 5â€™ end. 
        With these primers, we did not succeed in analyzing our samples. 
       Our first CE results showed strong background noise and also the length of the primer could not be analyzed properly, most likely due to insufficient purity of the primers. 
        To solve this problem we ordered new HPLC purified primers and also purified the samples with an ssDNA clean and concentrator kit before sending them in for analysis. 
        After those two steps, we managed to analyze our samples with a resolution of 1 nucleotide. 
        We used this technique to study the reaction rate of the TdT with different nucleotides and adapt our kinetic model.
