        # Conversation at the city archive in Aachen
        
        In order to be able to adapt our ideas to the later application, we got into contact with a potential user of our DNA data storage.
        We visited the city archive in Aachen to discuss long-term storage. 
        Archive manager Dr. René Rohrkamp revealed to us that the primary task of an archive is the disposal of information.
        Only 1-2% of the local information is stored in a city archive.
        The goal of Dr. Rohrkamp and the employees is to store data in such a way that even after a long time, it is possible to recognize what everyday life in Aachen used to be like.
        The city archive is currently in the process of digitalizing many documents and storing them in a long-term repository (server archive) in Cologne.
        However, this includes many problems: First, extremely high costs are involved. 
        Second, the current data storage devices are magnetic tapes with data decay and lack of robustness.
        These storage units must be regularly renewed.
        Third, for security, the electronic signature of the memories must be changed every few years as a seal of quality and a warning signal in case of hacker attacks.
        During our discussion, we also addressed the topic of data loss.
        Today much is clarified via email and not signed, stamped, and stored, which is why data is lost and a black hole of information is created.
        Furthermore, we wanted to know if the value of a document is diminished by digital storage.
        Digitalization is desirable, as this makes the documents available to the general public on the Internet.
        In conclusion, the city archive is looking for cheaper, uniform, and safe data storage.
        
        How we integrated this information into our project can be observed in [integrated human practices](TODO).
        Based on the proposals and expectations of the archive manager and employees of the city archive in Aachen we developed a guideline of information storage.

        # Meeting with Steven Benner
        
        Steven Benner, PhD is one of the pioneers in the field of synthetic biology and an expert in artificial genetic systems.
        We had the honor to present our topic to him and discuss the integration of unnatural base pairs into our DNA.
        
        Mr. Benner and his colleagues have developed a six-letter Artificially Expanded Genetic Information System (AEGIS), which includes two nonstandard nucleotides in addition to the four standard nucleotides [1](#citation1).
        According to Mr. Benner, integrating unnatural nucleotides like Z and P could have two main effects on our storage system: 
        A larger number of available nucleotides opens up new possibilities in coding and increases the storage capacity of the DNA. 
        A second effect is the decrease of secondary structure formation due to less equal sequences. 
        But, this could also have some negative impacts on the analysis of DNA, as unnatural nucleotides are not recognized in nanopore sequencing. 
        Therefore, we have made efforts to find other methods of analysis (more information here)[TODO]. 
        Additionally, unnatural nucleotides are not available on the market, so we have dealt with this issue mainly theoretically (read link to get more information). 
        
        Due to his many years of laboratory experience, Mr. Benner could also provide us with some additional recommendations. 
        Despite the view that the TdT can also accept unnatural nucleotides, this must be observed for our specific kind of TdT and reaction buffer [2](#citation2). 
        Mr. Benner also advised us not to use nucleotides with photolabile groups as their size probably prevents the incorporation by the TdT into ssDNA strands. 
        Based on these considerations, we have rethought our hardware and developed a new system, which is less oriented towards already known systems. 
        Mr. Benner also confirmed that the application of SSBs to avoid secondary structures is worth a try.
        
        In summary, we had a particularly enriching conversation with some valuable tips and tricks for the implementation of our project.

        # Meeting with Jost Muth and Lena Julie Freund from the Fraunhofer IME Aachen 

        To analyze our samples far more in detail, Sebastian Palluk suggested we to talk to the capillary electrophoresis (CE) experts from the Fraunhofer IME in Aachen.
        At the Fraunhofer IME they use an ABI3730 Genetic Analyzer to measure the length of for example PCR products. For this analysis method, our DNA had to be labeled with a fluorescent dye.
        Mrs. Freund suggested to use the 6FAM dye because of its low costs and good results.
        Through multiple questions, we concluded that the CE is an optimal analysis method for our samples because the DNA does not have to be double-stranded as the samples are denatured before analysis anyway. 
        Furthermore, the size range from 35 nt to 500 nt within 1 nt resolution is the range of our synthesized fragments.
        After the questions, Mrs. Freund and Mr. Muth offered to support our project by trying to analyze our samples, help us with the interpretation of the data, and being open to questions in the future.
        Later, we had some more meetings to work out the analysis of our created DNA samples, which subsequently performed well. 
        Our Modeling team used this data to adapt their model.

        # Meeting with Maximilian Schmidt from FZ Jülich
        
        Maximilian Schmidt is a member of the section IBG-4 Bioinformatics in FZ Jülich.
        We contacted him referring some questions about the Nanopore Sequencing with the MinION from Oxford Nanopore. 
        For our progress in the lab, it is necessary to sequence the DNA strands we created, but there are some difficulties because of our specific method. 
        So, we scheduled some meetings with Maximilian where we presented our project and talked about possible sequencing methods.
        He offered to join us in the lab and bring his MinION to analyze our samples with his help.
        It was exciting to learn about the sequence method of the MinION, and it was an excellent opportunity to ask as many questions about it as we wanted. 
        Maximilian was very committed to sharing his experiences with us and was very helpful.
        At the end of the day, sequencing was successful, and we had a lot of new data for our project progress.

        # Meeting with Prof. Weinhold 
        
        Prof. Weinhold accompanied us on our path from the very beginning of our journey in February where we were still figuring out our topic. 
        He is an organic chemist focusing on tools for genomics and proteomics. 
        Weinhold directly was enthusiastic about our project. 
        He pointed out a few challenges we might be facing in course of our work in the wet lab. 
        On our second meeting in March, we discussed the prevention of secondary structures and he advised us to use photolabile protecting groups (read more about it in the outlook). 
        We also discussed the possibility of incorporating unnatural bases and elaborated that Deep Sequencing could be useful in this regard. 
        He then helped us establish contact with Steven Benner.
        Quite at the end of our journey in September we also turned to Prof. Weinhold when we were struggling with our immobilization system. 
        He advised us to try out the Streptavidin-Biotin magnetic immobilization, which ended up being our preferred system. 
        Weinhold always met us with lots of positivity and enthusiasm and motivated us throughout the competition.

        # Meeting with Dr. Florian Kraft
    
        Next-generation sequencing is a modern sequencing method, which enables massively parallel sequencing of numerous genes and has thus revolutionized genetic diagnostics in recent years. 
        Dr. Florian Kraft, post-doc at the Institut for human genetic in the uni hospital in Aachen, deals precisely with New Sequencing techniques, especially Nanopore sequencing, which is our preferrable method to analyze our synthesized sequences.
        Before our meeting and towards the end of our project we exchanged a lot of E-Mail’s and asked Dr. Kraft many questions about our samples for Nanopore sequencing,  which he was always happy to answer. 
        During our meeting in the middle of April, he explained the requirements for Nanopore-sequencing, such as the right primer length for Nanopore-sequencing. 
        He raised the issue that using Homopolymers may be difficult because the nanopore could not detect the length of the polymer. 
        Furthermore, we assessed the problem of adding his double-stranded nanopore adapters to our single-stranded DNA. 
        Eventually, he proposed the opportunity to sequence our samples at the uni hospital at a low cost.
        We gladly accepted his offer and want to thank Dr. Kraft again for the great opportunity!

        # Meeting with Prof. Doerte Rother, Dr. Thorsten Sehl, Jan-Dirk-Spoering 
        
        In June we met with Prof. Doerte Rother, Dr. Thorsten Sehl and Jan Dirk-Spöring from FZ Jülich from the group of Biocatalysis. 
        Dörte Rother is an expert in the field of enzyme immobilization and showed us possibilities which suit our purposes. 
        Back then, we haven’t decided whether we should immobilize a biotinylated primer on a Streptavidin plate, which is inspired by George Church, or use the new “Dip method”. 
        Prof. Rother elaborated every immobilization method with us, showing us advantages and challenges. 
        For the case that we choose the first approach, she warned us that immobilizing the enzyme by dialysis or any other kind of membrane could be disadvantageous because it can be blocked by the material fast. 
        For the dipping method she advised us to immobilize biotinylated primer on a Streptavidin-coated magnetic bead and to use a magnetic stick. 
        A few months later that turned out to be our preferred immobilization method. She also took notice that the efficiency of the enzyme could decrease after the immobilization.
        In conclusion, we had an informative and pleasant discussion.

        # Meeting with Dr. Martin Zimmermann
        
        Especially at the beginning of our project, we had severe problems with our analytics. Gels did not run well, samples were not visible and many members of our team had little to no lab experience.
        Dr. Martin Zimmermann is not only the study coordinator of the Biological Sciences faculty, but he is also an expert in many biological fields including biological analysis methods.
        During the whole project, we repeatedly exchanged E-Mails, where he answered our questions with much detail and knowledge.
        We met with Dr. Zimmermann at the end of Mai. He introduced denaturated Polyacrylamide gels to us and helped us establish the right analytics for our samples. Among other things, we discussed gel runtime, gel size, the right voltage for our samples, and staining methods of our gels.
        To get a better resolution Dr. Zimmermann advised us to use TBE buffer, which has a higher buffer capacity.
        Furthermore, he suggested silver staining as a sustainable method to stain PAA gels and longer primers to establish better reaction conditions for our Enzym, which we implemented rapidly.
        At the end of our Meeting, Dr. Zimmermann once more drew attention to Polyacrylamide. He advised us to be extra careful when handling the neurotoxic chemical. Click here to see our safety guidelines.

        # Meeting with Dr. Sebastian Palluk
    
        Dr. Palluk is co-founder and CTO of Ansa Biotechnologies, a startup developing enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies. When we were younger he participated in the iGEM competition himself and found it challenging that synthesizing DNA was such a difficult task. Nowadays he works with a genetically modified TdT for biological Applications and aims to improve the synthesis system for future implications.
        Mr. Palluk was probably one of our most important experts. We met with him three times in total and had intensive E-Mail contact during the whole project.
        In our first meeting, we started off presenting our ideas and two approaches to encode data on DNA.
        Furthermore, we discussed four different ideas to prevent the secondary structure formation of our ssDNA primers and the affinity of the TdT for 3´OH base modifications.
        Mr. Palluk commented on our ideas on immobilization and explained briefly streptavidin immobilization on magnetic beads as well as sequencing techniques like Nanopore sequencing and capillary-electrophorese to view the length distribution.
        To conclude our first meeting, Mr. Palluk gave us a great overview of many important tasks we have to tackle in the future and was sure that we had all the resources to establish a unique interdisciplinary and round project, but that would probably be much harder to implement as we thought.

        In our second meeting with Mr. Palluk, at the beginning of May, we presented our possibilities to hinder secondary structures.
        He recommended starting our first experiments in solution with purification steps to establish our methods. Furthermore, he emphasized parallelizing the immobilization while still doing our first experiments.
        Mr. Palluk advised us to analyze the length of strands with gel-electrophoresis and explained that driving PCR reaction beforehand is not necessarily essential.
        Afterward, we discussed the possibilities for sequencing our strands, where he explained that sanger sequencing would only be possible if we would do a vector cloning beforehand.

        In our third meeting, at the beginning of September, we discussed our ideas for building a hardware and explained the Maleimid-Cysteine binding system. Additionally, we examined the problem of our immobilization. With our current system, we would lose lots of Maleimid, which is too expensive for us. Mr. Palluk suggested using a Peptide-tag which would be immobilized the whole time and bind oligos with homolog sequences and overhangs. The TdT would bind at the overhangs and heat would remove it.
        Together, we establish a „plan B“ for the immobilization. To create base transitions in solution by adding nucleotide in excess, let the reaction finish and add another nucleotide.
        To put it in a nutshell, Mr. Palluk was a very important expert for us who helped us create many solutions to our problem. Nobody knows the TdT better than he does. Thank you again Mr. Palluk for answering all our questions and E-Mails!
