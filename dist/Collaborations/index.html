A lot of iGEM teams from all over the world were part of it. We discussed with a lot of teams where to start with their project and how to participate in the competition. In addition to that, we got to know our cooperation partners iGEM Tue, iGEM Düsseldorf, and iGEM Bonn.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Collaborations/OSUMeetUp.jpg" alt=""><p>Figure 1:</p></div><h1>International Survey about GMOs</h1><p>In May we met with iGEM Maastricht. They asked if we are interested in creating a survey about GMOs with iGEM IISER Tirupati and iGEM IISER Pune. In a few meetings, we designed a questionnaire with specific questions about the topics the different teams were working on. We were really interested in how the attitude towards GMOs changes depending on age and education.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Collaborations/Maastricht_all.png" alt="Picture of our collaboration meeting"><p>Figure 2: Picture of our collaboration meeting</p></div><h1>iGEM Monument Challenge</h1><p>During the summer iGEM GO Paris Saclay organized the iGEM Monument Challenge. We thought that it was a really great idea and took part in it. We showed the Karlsbrunnen, Aachens Cathedral and the Elisenbrunnen.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Collaborations/MonumentChallenge1.jpg" alt="Aachens Cathedral"><p>Figure 3: Aachens Cathedral</p></div><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Collaborations/MonumentChallenge2.jpg" alt="Karlsbrunnen"><p>Figure 4: Karlsbrunnen</p></div><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Collaborations/MonumentChallenge3.jpg" alt="Elisenbrunnen"><p>Figure 5: Elisenbrunnen</p></div><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Collaborations/MonumentChallengePost.jpg" alt="Our Instagram Post"><p>Figure 6: Our Instagram Post</p></div><h1>Postcard Challenge</h1><p>As every year the iGEM Team of the Heinrich-Heine-University reached out to us offering to participate in their postcard challenge. The task was to design a synthetic biology or project-related postcard and to send copies to Düsseldorf. In return, they send us postcards of the other participating teams. Our postcard shows a TdT cartoon-like with DNA. We decided on this illustration because the TdT was the main enzyme for our project.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Collaborations/Postcard_Front.png" alt="Our postcard"><p>Figure 7: Our postcard</p></div><h1>Rosalind Chronicles</h1><p>As part of a collaboration between the Ulaval, Thessaloniki, Patras and Concordia iGEM teams on the topic of women in STEM research, we participated in their &quot;Rosalind Chronicles&quot; project. They called for an entry that would honor influential and innovative women in science. Each participating team wrote a text about their favorite female scientist. Since all members of our team agreed that women in STEM research have often been overlooked in the past, we chose a female researcher from the last century. Maud Leonora Menten worked in the field of enzyme kinetics and is famous for the &quot;Michaelis-Menten equation&quot; - a term everyone in biochemical subjects knows. We were impressed by her determination to work in what was then a male-dominated field, and by her decision to even move to Germany for research purposes because she was not allowed to do so in Canada. Michaelis-Menten kinetics also played an important role in modeling our TdT reaction, as we used the equation for calculations on dNTP incorporation (see <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Model#Michaelis-Menten">Modeling</a>). We thank the four organizing teams for the great opportunity to get to know other inspiring female scientists!</p><blockquote><p>Maud Leonora Menten (March 20, 1879 -July 17, 1960) was a biomedical and medical researcher who is known for her work on enzyme kinetics and histochemistry. She studied medicine at the University of Toronto and was among the first women in Canada to earn a medical doctorate. Because women were not allowed to do research at the time, she decided to do research in other countries, such as Germany and the United States. In Berlin (1912) she worked together with Leonor Michaelis and co-authored their paper in Biochemische Zeitschrift. They showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the amount of the enzyme-substrate complex. This relationship is known as the Michaelis-Menten equation. She entered graduate school at the University of Chicago and obtained her PhD in 1916. From 1923-1950 she worked at the University of Pittsburgh and became Assistant Professor and then Associate Professor in the school of medicine and head of pathology at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. In 1948 at the Medical School of the University of Pittsburgh she was awarded a professorship.</p></blockquote><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Collaborations/rosalindChronicles1.jpg" alt="The assembled Rosalind Chronicles"><p>Figure 8: The assembled Rosalind Chronicles</p></div><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Collaborations/rosalindChronicles2.jpg" alt="The collaboration also featured pictures of the female members of all participating teams"><p>Figure 9: The collaboration also featured pictures of the female members of all participating teams</p></div><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Collaborations/rosalindChronicles3.png" alt="Women in STEM workshop organized by iGEM Concordia, ULaval, Patras and Thessaloniki "><p>Figure 10: Women in STEM workshop organized by iGEM Concordia, ULaval, Patras and Thessaloniki</p></div></article></div></div></div></nav><footer><div class="container"><div class="us"><h1>iGEM Aachen 2021</h1><h3>Follow Us</h3><div class="socialmedia"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/igem.Aachen/"><i class="fab fa-instagram-square fa-2x"></i></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/iGEMAachen"><i class="fab fa-facebook-square fa-2x"></i></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnIsgLJVUFhwqUYJtdd2tIA/videos"><i class="fab fa-youtube-square fa-2x"></i></a></div><h3>Contact Us</h3><div class="socialmedia"><a href="http://igem.rwth-aachen.de"><i class="fas fa-globe fa-2x"></i></a><a href="mailto:iGEM@rwth-aachen.de"><i class="fas fa-envelope-square fa-2x"></i></a></div></div></div><div class="sponsors"><div class="container"><img src="../assets/img/all_sponsors.png"></div></div></footer><script src="../content.bundle.js"></script></body></html>
