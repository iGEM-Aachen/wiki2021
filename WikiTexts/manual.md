#The Format
---
1. Where does the text belong? (e.g. /modeling)
2. At which place on the site does the text belong? (Under the navigation bar on the right)
3. Special requirements (Animations, colors, etc.)

#How can you format your text?
---
* If you want to format your text, like making some elements **bold** or `italic` then use double asterisks(\*\*bold\*\*) or backticks (\`italic\`)
* If you want to use links like [I'm a link](http://igem.rwth-aachen.de) then use square brackets followed by normal brackets: \[I'm a link\](http://igem.rwth-aachen.de)
* Most of the formatting is explained [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) in detail.
