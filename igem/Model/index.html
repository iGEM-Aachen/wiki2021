Since the key to our synthesis is a chemical reaction we started by constructing a model simulating the elongation of our primer. Using this model we can predict concentrations of DNA strands of different lengths in dependence on parameters like time, nucleotide concentration or enzyme concentration. We aspired to go through a complete modeling process. From constructing a reaction network to evaluating the model with experimental data and finally applying it to gain knowledge about certain kinetic parameters, like e.g. the length of the synthesis cycle, to support our wet-lab work. In the best-case scenario, we would construct a new dynamic model which would also fit with the experimental results. Generally speaking, the most important aspect of modeling is to gain knowledge about certain problems.</p><h1>Fundamentals of kinetics modeling</h1><p>The fundamental idea behind a reaction network is that the concentration of each component in the network is represented by a so-called pool. When one component reacts to become another one, the pools are connected. This connection is called flux and represents the change of substance a and b.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Pools and fluxes of DNA elongation by the TdT." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/5/5a/T--Aachen--img--modeling_Bilder--reaction_system.PNG"/><p>Figure 1: Pools and fluxes of DNA elongation by the TdT.</p></div><p>Since the fluxes are not constant and depend on the pool sizes, they need to be integrated over time in order to know the concentration at a certain timepoint.</p><p>In order to be able to apply this model some assumptions need to be made:</p><ul><li>the reverse reaction does not happen</li><li>the pool size of DNAn has no influence on the reactions velocity vn</li><li>enzyme and DNA dissociate after each reaction</li></ul><h1>Michaelis-Menten</h1><p>The first approach was to model the reaction according to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Therefore the nucleotide that would be incorporated was considered as the substrate and the DNA strands were assumed to be present in excess. Thereby the reaction velocity could be calculated by the Michaelis-Menten equation with a value for the dNTP affinity from the literature <a href="#citation2">2</a>. For each length of the resulting DNA strands, a new pool was created and the flux from one pool to the next was modeled as explained. As result, the concentrations of the different lengths of the DNA strands were obtained as a function of the time (figure 1). The most interesting part here was the concentration of strands that were not elongated at all since these would lead to an error in the encoded information. This approach however could be improved. As we found out later that the enzyme was not saturated with DNA strands in our lab conditions, a new kinetic model elaborated. Since the TdT catalyzes reactions in two substrates, two product random order mechanisms <a href="#citation1">1</a> a corresponding equation was used.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Concentrations of the DNA length over time.

In figure 3, a delayed rise in concentrations can be seen. This is explained by the dependency of the flux towards DNA1 to the pool size of DNA0 et cetera.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Concentrations of DNA pools over time." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/8/83/T--Aachen--img--modeling_Bilder--concentrations.png"/><p>Figure 3: Concentrations of DNA pools over time.</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="Distribution of DNA lengths at different timestamps." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/a/a2/T--Aachen--img--modeling_Bilder--strand-length-distribution.png"/><p>Figure 4: Distribution of DNA lengths at different timestamps.</p></div><p>With increasing time the mean of the strand length distribution rises and the distribution becomes broader. Although this result was not surprising, it is still valuable, because it shows that the reaction time should be as short as possible, not only to shorten synthesis cycles but also to avoid longer strands. The gained data from the capillary electrophoresis confirms our model <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Results">Results capillary electrophoresis</a>. The concentration decreases along with an increasing strand length distribution.</p><h1>Optimization</h1><p>To not only gain an understanding of the reaction, but also find the ideal reaction conditions, we did a parameter analysis. Because we are facing an optimization problem for our system (Error rate, time, concentration) we want to find the ideal operating point for our DNA synthesis. The independent parameters are enzyme- and nucleotide concentration and reaction time. The repercussions of a change of these parameters are shown in figure 5.</p><div class="image"><img alt="optimization problem of our system." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/1/16/T--Aachen--img--modeling_Bilder--optimization.png"/><p>Figure 5: optimization problem of our system.</p></div><p>In order to calculate these reaction parameters we varied the nucleotide concentration and plotted the course of the reaction for each concentration to get a 3 dimensional plot. The same procedure was performed with time and nucleotide concentration as independent parameters. Because we are facing an optimization problem in our system, we need data like this to find the ideal reaction conditions.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Percentage of strands with atleast one elongation in dependence of time and dNTP starting concentration." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/4/46/T--Aachen--img--modeling_Bilder--3D_colourmap.png"/><p>Figure 6: Percentage of strands with atleast one elongation in dependence of time and dNTP starting concentration.</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="Percentage of strands with atleast one elongation in dependence of time and enzyme units." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/9/9b/T--Aachen--img--modeling_Bilder--vmax-3D-pot-colourmap.png"/><p>Figure 7: Percentage of strands with atleast one elongation in dependence of time and enzyme units.</p></div><p>As can be seen, the nucleotide concentration, here ATP, has a rather small influence on the velocity of the reaction, especially at longer reaction times. By contrast, the amount of enzyme naturally has a drastic influence on the reaction's velocity at every reaction time. Since the enzyme is the most expensive component in our system and has the biggest influence on reaction velocity, its optimized use is the top priority.</p><h1>Applying Wet Lab Data</h1><p>To evaluate our simulation results we compared them with the experimental data gained from the capillary electrophoresis. This experiment is particularly suitable because a large amount of data is available in digital form. Since our network consists of coupled differential equations, we wrote a nonlinear regression program in MATLAB.<br/>These reaction networks are normally time-dependent so time is the only variable during a reaction in the same reaction setup. Since our system consists of three kinetic parameters, we compared our used parameters <a href="#citation2">2</a>, with the calculated ones from the regression program. This way we could validate our model and compare the differences between literature, our model, and the experimental results. All of the above-mentioned was done with the “lsqcurvefit” command of Matlab. This is a nonlinear curve-fitting solver that solves the defined problem in a least-squares sense. Solvers which work like ours define a minimization function that first subtracts the simulated results from the experimental ones. The results of that then get squared and the squared values get added up. This function gets minimized by varying the defined system parameters until the solver reaches a minimum for the function. The set of values for the parameters for which the minimum is found is then the end result. This would be the ideal set of kinetic parameters which fit the best with the experimental data.</p><p>For the regression, we also used previous modeling results to simplify the system, which helped to reduce the computing time and made the model more efficient. Instead of using a time-dependent pool for the ATPs in the reaction equations, we just used a constant value for the ATP concentration. This assumption was made because with the three-dimensional plot we found out that the starting concentration of the nucleotides barely influences the kinetics of the reaction network. This makes sense considering the phenomenon of substrate saturating, which plays a key factor in enzyme kinetics. So for our examined time interval for the elongation process, we make the assumption that our system is saturated with ATP.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Regression of the capillary electrophoresis data. Results for the first three pools(DNA0: non-elongated DNA strand, DNA1: strand which got elongated by one base pair,DNA2: strand which got elongated by two base pairs)" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/1/16/T--Aachen--img--modeling_Bilder--regression_of_CE-data.jpg"/><p>Figure 8: Regression of the capillary electrophoresis data. Results for the first three pools(DNA0: non-elongated DNA strand, DNA1: strand which got elongated by one base pair,DNA2: strand which got elongated by two base pairs)</p></div><p>In the following, the regression results are discussed. The upper plot shows the results for the first three pools (non-elongated DNA strand, DNA strand which got elongated by one base pair, and the DNA strand which got elongated by two base pairs). We limited the plot to these three pools because more graphs would make the plot unclear. Regression analysis is usually a tough task in biological fields because there are way higher measurement errors than in other disciplines. Besides our simulated results fit very well to the wet lab data which is astonishing, considering the fact that we constructed a completely new and multilayered model with our own assumptions. The new estimated kinetic parameters are:</p><ul><li>v_max = 0.00006150 mol/s<em>g (0.0000083 mol/s</em>g in literature)</li><li>K_DNA = 0.00015318 M (0.001 M in literature)</li><li>K_ATP = 0.00021808 M (0.0001 M in literature)</li></ul><h1>Conclusion and Outlook</h1><p>By Modelling the reaction system of the DNA synthesis in silico, we could gain much information about how the system behaves. This helped us to understand the kinetics of the elongation reaction and which are the important factors to be analyzed in more detail.<br/>After understanding the reaction process in detail, the data we obtained from the Capillary electrophoresis was used to adjust the parameters from the literature to our model. Furthermore, we evaluated the influences of varying the most important factors and found effective optimization approaches. With the data we generated, we could help the wet lab team to find the most efficient approach to optimize the reaction conditions.</p><p>Our model could be extended to gain further insights into possible optimization. First, the CE experiment could be repeated to minimize wet-lab data errors. Further, the synthesis could be performed with our hardware to adapt the model to our hardware parameters. In order to describe especially our hardware. Yet we just studied short elongation with one nucleotide sort. Along with this modification effects like secondary structures and other molecular interactions affect the reaction kinetics.</p></article><article id="references"><h1>References</h1><ol><li id="citation1"><p class="author">Ross L.
