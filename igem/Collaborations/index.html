A lot of iGEM teams from all over the world were part of it. We discussed with a lot of teams where to start with their project and how to participate in the competition. In addition to that, we got to know our cooperation partners iGEM Tue, iGEM Düsseldorf, and iGEM Bonn.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Instagram story from the OSU meetup" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/6/6c/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--OSUMeetUp.jpg" style="width: 50%"/><p>Figure 1: Instagram story from the OSU meetup</p></div><h1>International Survey about GMOs</h1><p>In May we met with iGEM Maastricht. They asked if we are interested in creating a survey about GMOs with iGEM IISER Tirupati and iGEM IISER Pune. In a few meetings, we designed a questionnaire with specific questions about the topics the different teams were working on. We were really interested in how the attitude towards GMOs changes depending on age and education.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Picture of our collaboration meeting" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/e/e5/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--Maastricht_all.png"/><p>Figure 2: Picture of our collaboration meeting</p></div><h1>iGEM Monument Challenge</h1><p>During the summer iGEM GO Paris Saclay organized the iGEM Monument Challenge.

The task was to design a synthetic biology or project-related postcard and to send copies to Düsseldorf. In return, they send us postcards of the other participating teams. Our postcard shows a TdT cartoon-like with DNA. We decided on this illustration because the TdT was the main enzyme of our project.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Our postcard." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/2/26/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--Postcard_Front.png"/><p>Figure 7: Our postcard.</p></div><h1>Participation in iGEMxSDG Impact Challenge and Conference</h1><p>During the competition, we were asked to give a presentation in the conference organized by TAS_Taipei.

It is a great way of making science more accessible and appealing to people with different backgrounds or from different age groups. This year Team <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Thrace">iGEM Thrace</a> organized an Erasmus+ program on this topic, called “Science Communication Through Non-Typical Forms of Education” and we took part in it.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Group photo on the first day." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/a/a3/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--Greece1.jpg"/><p>Figure 8: Group photo on the first day.</p></div><p>Together with 16 other iGEM members from various countries, they examined the question of how to communicate science to the public. They started with brainstorming ideas and discussing the goals of science communication the month before the actual meet-up in Greece. For the meet-up <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Members">Clemens, Marie K., Willy, and Viktor</a> from our team traveled for one week to Greece, Alexandroupoli. After many workshops, the group learned how to communicate science in different unusual ways such as theatre, debate, music, drawing, etc. They set their goal to educate the locals on the following three scientific topics:</p><ol><li>Synthetic Biology</li><li>Vaccines</li><li>Climate Change</li></ol><p>For that, the group was divided into three teams that meticulously researched, wrote, and rehearsed throughout their stay. The teams had the one-of-a-kind opportunity to grasp the magic of theatre in the country where it emerged while working together with natives. This boosted their creativity and they managed to combine fun with an important take-home message for the audience. For days they were dedicated to creating their masterpiece through theatre, painting, and music.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Preparing the props for the theatre plays." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/9/92/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--Greece2.JPG"/><p>Figure 9: Preparing the props for the theatre plays.</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="Preparing the props for the theatre plays." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/8/83/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--Greece3.JPG"/><p>Figure 10: Preparing the props for the theatre plays.</p></div><p>The international group then reached out to people of all ages and backgrounds to invite them to their theatre performances through social media, flyers, and even the local radio. As a result, the play was attended by many people and even the city mayor. The plays ran like a well-oiled machine, everybody knew their tasks and did them thoroughly. In the end, the young Shakespeares were vigorously applauded by the audience and received a speech of gratitude from the mayor.</p><p>Upon their arrival back in Germany, our teammates implemented the gained knowledge about science communication and organized fun and educational dissemination activities. They hosted an online event together with the iGEM Teams <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Marburg">Marburg</a> and <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Hamburg">Hamburg</a> where they played a variation of hang-man with scientific words. Our teammates also went to the climate change protest march of Fridays For Future. Their goal was to educate people about the small changes that matter. Thus, our team members gave out flyers with some ideas on what one could change in their everyday life to prevent worsening of the climate change.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Malte, Clemens and Viktor at the climate change protest march of Fridays For Future." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/1/1a/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--Greece4.jpg"/><p>Figure 11: Malte, Clemens and Viktor at the climate change protest march of Fridays For Future.</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="Science communication online event." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/1/16/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--Greece5.png"/><p>Figure 12: Science communication online event.</p></div><p>All in all, the project was about a lot more than science communication and education. In Greece, every night people from a different country presented something traditional and universal from themselves such as a specific dance or delicious recipe. This certainly fulfilled the idea of Erasmus+ to spread the love between countries and created many new international friendships. Just like the magic of iGEM brings people all over the world together.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Group photo of all participating iGEM team members." src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/5/5c/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--Greece6.JPG"/><p>Figure 13: Group photo of all participating iGEM team members.</p></div><h1>iJET</h1><div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; color: black;"><p style="width: 50%;margin-right:5vw;">iGEM is a lot more than just a science project. It is about making the world a better place and bringing people from all over the world together. However, since the Covid-19 pandemic, this became a harder task. That inspired iGEM Team Darmstadt 2020 to collaborate with our ancestors in a way that became pretty usual during the past year. Together they managed to connect online with more than 25 other teams by letting the small paper plane iJET flying all over the world, compiling everything into a nice video. This years iGEM <a class="content" href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/">Team Darmstadt</a>continued the tradition and sent the small paper plane on a journey again. It flew through 33 different teams around the world including us. The product is a nice video produced by iGEM Team Darmstadt which can be seen here. A collaboration like this may seem small and insignificant, but it is proof that even in those hard times we can unite together and take a moment to smile and be joyful.</p><div style="width: 50%; height: 70%;"><video controls="" style="width: 100%;"><source src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/f/f2/T--Aachen--videos--iJET.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><span>Your browser does not support the video tag. :(</span></video></div></div><h1>Rosalind Chronicles</h1><p>As part of a collaboration between the <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:ULaval">Ulaval</a>, <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Patras">Patras</a> and <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Concordia-Montreal">Concordia</a> iGEM teams on the topic of women in STEM research, we participated in their "Rosalind Chronicles" project. They called for an entry that would honor influential and innovative women in science. Each participating team wrote a text about their favorite female scientist. Since all members of our team agreed that women in STEM research have often been overlooked in the past, we chose a female researcher from the last century. Maud Leonora Menten worked in the field of enzyme kinetics and is famous for the "Michaelis-Menten equation" - a term everyone in biochemical subjects knows. We were impressed by her determination to work in what was then a male-dominated field, and by her decision to even move to Germany for research purposes because she was not allowed to do so in Canada. Michaelis-Menten kinetics also played an important role in modeling our TdT reaction, as we used the equation for calculations on dNTP incorporation (see <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Model#Michaelis-Menten">Modeling</a>). We thank the four organizing teams for the great opportunity to get to know other inspiring female scientists!</p><blockquote><p>Maud Leonora Menten (March 20, 1879 -July 17, 1960) was a biomedical and medical researcher who is known for her work on enzyme kinetics and histochemistry. She studied medicine at the University of Toronto and was among the first women in Canada to earn a medical doctorate. Because women were not allowed to do research at the time, she decided to do research in other countries, such as Germany and the United States. In Berlin (1912) she worked together with Leonor Michaelis and co-authored their paper in Biochemische Zeitschrift. They showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the amount of the enzyme-substrate complex. This relationship is known as the Michaelis-Menten equation. She entered graduate school at the University of Chicago and obtained her PhD in 1916. From 1923-1950 she worked at the University of Pittsburgh and became Assistant Professor and then Associate Professor in the school of medicine and head of pathology at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. In 1948 at the Medical School of the University of Pittsburgh she was awarded a professorship.</p></blockquote><div class="image"><img alt="The assembled Rosalind Chronicles" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/a/ae/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--rosalindChronicles1.jpg"/><p>Figure 14: The assembled Rosalind Chronicles</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="The collaboration also featured pictures of the female members of all participating teams" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/9/9d/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--rosalindChronicles2.jpg"/><p>Figure 15: The collaboration also featured pictures of the female members of all participating teams</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="Women in STEM workshop organized by iGEM Concordia, ULaval, Patras and Thessaloniki " src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/c/c1/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--rosalindChronicles3.png"/><p>Figure 16: Women in STEM workshop organized by iGEM Concordia, ULaval, Patras and Thessaloniki</p></div><h1>Online Escape Room Collaboration</h1><p>During the corona crisis, it was hard for every team to meet up for collaborations in person. Together with <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Duesseldorf">iGEM Düsseldorf</a>, <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Bonn">Bonn</a> and <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:TU_Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a> we thought of a digital activity we could work on collectively and provide for other people. We came up with an online escape room: Solving riddles together and working yourselves through a story related to our projects ending at the giant jamboree! Over the course of about 4 months, we worked out a script about a journey through the 4 cities of the participating teams. We met in Discord occasionally to discuss the progress and exchange our ideas. Every team contributed pictures for the storyline and 3 riddles, in which you have to apply your biological knowledge to solve them. The parts were finally assembled by Annika from iGEM Bonn using Google forms. Our riddles broached the issues of DNA synthesis, replication, and sequencing since we used all of these techniques during our project. iGEM Bonn thematized Lanthanide metal recycling, Kaiserslautern followed with a part about modular cloning and Düsseldorf finished with a few riddles about pathogen recognition in plants. We had lots of fun creating the riddles and thank the other teams for the collaboration. We hope that some people had fun playing the escape room!</p><p>If you want to try the escape room for yourself, click <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_gZEv_zMvtW_8McYkuCj8cnNuWPG_XhM2ep2HWWwsu9f8EQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>.</p><div class="image"><img alt="The starter page of the escape room" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/6/6a/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--escapeRoom1.png" style="width: 80%"/><p>Figure 17: The starter page of the escape room</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="Our first riddle thematizing DNA restriction and transcription" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/f/f9/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--escapeRoom2.png" style="width: 80%"/><p>Figure 18: Our first riddle thematizing DNA restriction and transcription</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="The second riddle dealing with PCR primer design" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/6/60/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--escapeRoom3.png" style="width: 80%"/><p>Figure 19: The second riddle dealing with PCR primer design</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="Our last riddle created in analogy to the amino acid codon wheel" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/7/73/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--escapeRoom4.png" style="width: 80%"/><p>Figure 20: Our last riddle created in analogy to the amino acid codon wheel</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="The final post for announcing the collaboration on social media" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/6/6b/T--Aachen--img--Collaborations--escapeRoom5.png" style="width: 60%"/><p>Figure 21: The final post for announcing the collaboration on social media</p></div></article></div></div></div></nav><footer><div class="container"><div class="us"><h1>iGEM Aachen 2021</h1><h3>Follow Us</h3><div class="socialmedia"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/igem.Aachen/"><i class="fab fa-instagram-square fa-2x"></i></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/iGEMAachen"><i class="fab fa-facebook-square fa-2x"></i></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnIsgLJVUFhwqUYJtdd2tIA/videos"><i class="fab fa-youtube-square fa-2x"></i></a></div><h3>Contact Us</h3><div class="socialmedia"><a href="http://igem.rwth-aachen.de"><i class="fas fa-globe fa-2x"></i></a><a href="mailto:iGEM@rwth-aachen.de"><i class="fas fa-envelope-square fa-2x"></i></a></div></div></div><div class="sponsors"><div class="container"><img src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/a/af/T--Aachen--img--all_sponsors.png"/></div></div></footer><script src="https://2021.igem.org/Template:Aachen/content-bundleJS?action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript"></script></body></html>
