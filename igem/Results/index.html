For this, we performed various experiments with altered reaction conditions, such as dNTP concentration, primer concentration, incubation times, temperature, and cofactor concentration.</p><p>Please note that in all following results containing a gel image, a dsDNA marker was used as a reference even though the tailing reaction results in an ssDNA strand unless further processed in a PCR. The reason was that no suitable ssDNA marker was available for our purposes. Additionally, some results contain tailing reactions with strand length above the maximal strand length of the marker. Thus, we can only make estimations about the actual ssDNA strand length, and these estimations should be viewed with care.</p><h3>dNTP Incorporation Preference</h3><p>As the TdT accepts four different divalent metal cations – $Mn^{2+}$, $Mg^{2+}$, and $Co^{2+}$ - as a cofactor <a href="#citation1">1</a>, the initial experiment involved a <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Protocols">standard TdT reaction</a> with the cofactor of choice in this project, $Co^{2+}$. Furthermore, the reaction was performed at room temperature (RT = 24 °C) and 37 °C to compare possible variations in maximal tail length and tail length distribution.

According to the ThermoFisher product literature <a href="#citation2">2</a>, favored incorporation of dTTP, followed by dATP, is to be expected. However, the figure above shows a longer tail for dCTP compared to dATP at both RT and 37 °C. Furthermore, the reaction with dCTP at 37 °C resulted in a much sharper band than at RT (lanes 4 and 9). The same effect can be observed to a lesser extent for the reactions containing dATP and dGTP. These results suggest a possible positive effect of the temperature on the tail length distribution. However, all further experiments – with a few exceptions – were performed at RT because it allowed for a simpler approach in designing the hardware, and the higher temperature was thought to result in higher reaction speeds, which was not wanted in our case. The incorporation of dGTP appears to be the most inefficient, with only a few nt added at RT and 37 °C.</p><p>The same results were obtained in other experiments not listed in these results, verifying the incorporation preference for our reaction conditions. No possible explanation could be found for the deviant behavior in our experiments and the product literature from Thermo Fisher.</p><h3>Nucleotide Concentration</h3><p>With a reproducible gel electrophoresis method and a successful TdT reaction, the following experiments could start focussing on the effect of adjusting various reaction parameters. The first parameter tested was the concentration of dNTP in the reaction mixture to identify potential effects on the reaction speed.</p><div class="image"><img alt="TdT tailing reaction of an AT-rich ssDNA primer with a range of initial dATP concentrations ranging from 1-1000 µM at RT (24 °C) for 10 min. 2.5% Agarose with TBE, SYBR Gold staining, 90 V, 55 min.

However, all samples can be distinguished from the primer reference in lane 1. Considering the slight curvature, all samples have an estimated length of around 250 nt. This suggests no effect of initial nucleotide concentration in the tested range. It must be noted that this is only true for an incubation time of 10 min. To fully understand the effect of the initial nucleotide concentration, this experiment should be adjusted, and a time-dependent reaction should be performed for every concentration tested since [3] claim that the initial nucleotide concentration is a reliable way of tweaking the reaction speed. The results presented here are only a snapshot, which cannot serve to make reliable suggestions. However, we chose to continue to work with our standard concentration of 100 µM as they were sufficient for the characterizations. Nevertheless, this concentration may be subject to change depending on the experiment performed.</p><h3>Varying Primer Concentration</h3><h3>Varying Cofactor Concentration</h3><h3>Time Dependent TdT Reaction</h3><p>Thus far, reaction times were chosen to yield a distinguishable band from the primer reference or across samples. However, the goal is to tune down the reaction to a point at which only a few bases are incorporated in each reaction. With adjusting the cofactor concentration, we wanted to slow down the reaction speed. Additionally, the reaction time is an adjustable parameter that does not slow down the reaction but restricts the number of dNTPs added according to time.</p><div class="image"><img alt="TdT tailing reaction of an AT-rich ssDNA primer with dTTP and various reaction times ranging from 1-90 min at RT (24 °C). 2.5% Agarose with TBE, SYBR Gold staining, 90 V, 51 min,.

However, the obtained results can only be used to get a rough estimate of the speed at which dTTP is incorporated since we still have to compare an ssDNA result against a dsDNA ladder, and four of the six samples exceed the highest ladder reference. Thus, lane 2 constitutes the most relevant band at around 200 nt after 1 min. It suggests that reaction times in the range of a few seconds will likely be needed to only add a few bases, which is the ultimate goal for our hardware. But, working on the scale of seconds makes reliable sample taking and subsequent inactivation difficult, so no further experimentation was performed with this setup. Instead, these results helped set the expectation of a possible time scale when later working the immobilized primers in the hardware.</p><h3>Comparison of Thermo Fisher Scientific and NEB TdT</h3><h2>Primer Immobilization</h2><h3>Testing the Immobilization System</h3><h3>Immobilization with Amino-Primer</h3><h3>Immobilization with Maleimide-Primer</h3><p>The maleimide-cysteine-bond was more likely to work than the amino bond because it was already shown to work with maleimide-labeled proteins [citation schwaneberg paper]. Thus, we switched methods as soon as the maleimide-labeled oligos arrived and performed the conjugation of the oligos with the fusion protein construct LCI-DZ-C-His6 (see Experiments). The conjugation was performed with the AT-rich oligo and the GC-rich oligo and different oligo excesses were tried. Assuming that successfully binding the protein construct to the oligo would change its running behavior, we performed an agarose gel electrophoresis with the conjugates.</p><div class="image"><img alt="**Conjugations of LCI-fusion-protein with AT-rich and GC-rich maleimide-labeled ssDNA primers and different primer excesses.** 2.5% Agarose with TBE, 90 V, 60 min, SYBR Gold staining.

The GC-rich oligo runs lower than the AT-rich oligo because of secondary structure formation in the native gel. The conjugates show large smears with a band at the height of the reference oligo, respectively. The more oligo excess was used, the brighter the smear and the bands are because there is more DNA in the sample. These results could have indicated a successful conjugation. We wanted to confirm this by purifying the conjugate using the His-Tag to lose excess primer and performing an SDS-PAGE and western blot as well as a TdT reaction with the purified conjugates. This should have confirmed if the bonding of oligo and protein was successful. Unfortunately, the blot did not work and we did not have enough of the samples to try again.</p><div class="image"><img alt="**Standard TdT reactions with dTTP with purified conjugations of LCI-fusion-protein and ssDNA primers.** 2.5% Agarose with TBE, 90 V, 60 min, SYBR Gold staining.

They were expected to be higher than the reference because the protein should increase the molecular weight. But because of the smear in the GC reference sample, it is hard to say if the GC conjugates are on the same height.</p><p>The TdT reaction with the conjugates seems to have worked; attaching nucleotides to the oligos increases the DNA concentration so you can see the bands. The bands are smeared and not at the same heights. Lane 6 and 8 show higher bands because these were the samples with lower oligo excess. Less DNA leads to further elongation because there are more nucleotides available for each strand. Taking a closer look, there are two bands visible in the smears. This could either mean, that the conjugation worked and what we see is only conjugated elongated primer, or what we see is only free primer that has not been washed away in the purification. We have shown, that even very small concentrations of primer are visible on the gel after elongation with TdT (link). Most likely, it is a combination of the two assumptions: There is conjugated primer as well as free primer, which would explain the faint double bands.</p><p>We then tried immobilizing the conjugates on a polystyrene stick, washing them and eluting the conjugate. This should confirm if the conjugation, as well as the immobilization, worked because the excess primer (if there is some) should be lost in the washing steps. Un-conjugated primer served as a negative control to see if it binds the stick without the anchor peptide. Furthermore, a TdT reaction was performed in the immobilized state.</p><div class="image"><img alt="**Immobilization of purified conjugates of LCI-fusion-protein and ssDNA primers on polystyrene stick.

The primer reference is visible the negative control shows no band in the second washing step or elution step. This could mean that the primer does not bind to the stick without the anchor peptide, but we cannot exclude the possibility because gel electrophoresis is not very sensitive and there are barely bands visible in the samples. The conjugates are again not visible, but an elution band can be seen in lanes 8, 16, and 32. These are the samples with the conjugates with higher primer excess and also the samples without TdT reaction. This could confirm, that the immobilization works, the conjugate is not washed off and can be eluted.</p><p>The results with the TdT reaction samples are not as expected because there are no bands visible in the elution step. However, there are bands in the lanes before the elution steps that seem to be stuck in the pocket. These samples are taken from the TdT reaction mix we incubated the stick in. We forgot to inactivate these samples so the primers were most likely elongated until there were no nucleotides left. There are two explanations for this: There could be components in the TdT reaction buffer that break up the maleimide-cysteine bond or detach the anchor peptide. Or this still could be a small rest of free primer that survived the purification and the washing steps and was now elongated to reach a visible concentration.</p><p>To illuminate the cause, we wanted to examine these samples further for the presence of protein. Assuming the strands were very long, a 1% agarose gel with GeneRuler 1 kb DNA Ladder was used. We also tried performing a PCR reaction with those samples but forgot the poly-A tailing.

The reaction bands ran even higher than the Ladder and there still seems to be some of the sample stuck in the pocket. The bands from lanes 3, 5, 7, 9 as well as the bands in the respective pockets were excised. The assumption was, that the lower band could be free elongated primer and the band in the pocket could be the elongated conjugate that was stuck there because of the protein. The samples were dissolved in agarose dissolving buffer, one part was purified and a dot blot (immunoblot) was performed to confirm or falsify the presence of protein.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Purified TdT reaction solution samples from gel (figure x).

This concludes, that our fusion protein was not present in the samples and the conjugation did not work well enough to be able to perform a cyclic synthesis with the immobilized primers. We decided to switch to the next immobilization method.</p><h3>Immobilization with Biotin-labelled Primer</h3><p>Our third immobilization method was a combination of streptavidin-tagged magnet beads and biotin-labelled primers. The magnet beads in turn are able to bind to a magnet stick. This construction allowed a permanent or non-permanent immobilization of primers.</p><h4>Permanent Immobilization</h4><p>For the permanent immobilization, the streptavidin-tagged magnet beads were conjugated with biotin-labelled primers. After adding the magnet stick to this solution and two washing steps, the immobilized primer could be released using BXT Strep-Tactin®XT elution buffer (IBA Life Science) containing biotin. To visualize our results, an agarose gel electrophoresis was performed (figure x). We assume, that most of the primer was bound by magnet beads because there was no detectible DNA in the conjugation mixture left. The binding seems to be strong enough because there was no detectible DNA in the two wash rests. A controlled elution of the primers was possible, indicated by a band at primer height.</p><div class="image"><img alt="&lt;b&gt;Permanent immobilization using biotin-streptavidin binding.&lt;/b&gt; A) Magnet beads and primer were conjugated first, and the magnet stick was added afterwards.

The above mentioned experiment was repeated using the second method. However, the results of this procedure showed less amounts of immobilized primer (figure x). Barely no DNA was detected in the elution step. The primers probably did not bind to the magnet beads due to steric hindrance. This is indicated by a band at primer height in the conjugation mixture.</p><h4>Non-permanent immobilization</h4><p>The non-permanent immobilization allows a release of primers into solution to avoid steric hindrance. For this, biotin-labelled primers were conjugated with magnet beads. Instead of directly dipping the magnet stick into this solution, the stick was covered with a plastic envelope. This prevented the magnet beads to bind to the stick irreversibly. Another advantage is, that the stick can be reused. To analyze this method, an agarose gel electrophoresis was performed with different steps of immobilization, washing and elution (figure x). The magnetic binding was apparently not weakened by the envelope because there was no DNA detected in the immobilization rest.</p><div class="image"><img alt="**Non-permanent primer immobilization using biotin-streptavidin binding.** 2.5% Agarose TBE, SYBR Gold, 90 V, ? min.

The non-permanent immobilization was able to safely bind the primer as well. To further investigate the occurrences, TdT reactions were performed using both successful methods.</p><h2>Cyclic Synthesis</h2><h3>In Solution</h3><h3>Immobilized</h3><h2>Secondary Structures</h2><h3>GC vs AT Primer</h3><h3>SSBs</h3><h3>short Oligos</h3><h1>Conclusion</h1><h1>Outlook</h1><p>There are many more experiments we would have liked to perform.
