# Experiments
This section should contain a summary of the experiments we did, why we decided to do them and (roughly) how we did it.
## TdT Tailing Reaction
The first step was to test whether the enzyme, terminal tranferase (TdT), binds nucleotides to a primer. This was the first important step to test whether our project would work at all and to find an analytical method with which we could detect the reaction.
For this purpose, mixtures were first prepared containing buffer, the respective nucleotide, primer and water.  To start the reaction, the TdT was added last and incubated for a certain time at room temperature and 30 degrees Celsius. The reaction was then analyzed by gel electrophoresis by plotting a marker, a control with pure primer, and the samples such that a size difference was visible when the tailing reaction was successful.
Since it was difficult to detect a reaction at the beginning, many parameters such as incubation time, temperature, nucleotide, primer as well as TdT concentration were varied. In addition, gel electrophoresis was optimized by using a different buffer, trying polyacrylamide gels, and varying the dye used to stain the gels.
